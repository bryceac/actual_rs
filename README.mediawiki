'''Description:''' Rust port of [https://github.com/bryceac/ActualStorage-Swift Actual Storage].

'''Version:''' 0.1

'''Creator:''' Bryce Campbell

'''License:''' See LICENSE

==Notes==

This has only been tested on Windows 10, but should work on anything that can compile and run Rust applications.

This <strong>should</strong> work exactly the same as the Swift version, which has migrated over to the Swift Package Manager.

===Building===

This tool requires Cargo, which should be included as part of the [https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html Rust installation process], as that is the only way to deal with the dependencies.

To build the program, run the following in the cloned or unarchived repository:

<pre>
cargo build
</pre>

This will build the application for testing purposes, so it can read the included JSON file, as the release build requires the JSOn and the binary to be together.

Also, thanks to the included wix folder, an MSI can be generated via [https://github.com/volks73/cargo-wix cargo-wix] and will ensure that the JSON file is included with the installer.
